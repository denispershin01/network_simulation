# Network Protocols

* Read more about [flood algorithm](https://ecomputernotes.com/computernetworkingnotes/communication-networks/flooding)

* Read more about [leach algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-energy_adaptive_clustering_hierarchy)

* Now working on a heuristic algorithm


## Requirements

* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

* [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/denispershin01/network_simulation.git
cd network_protocols
```

2. Install all required packages in `Requirements` section.

3. Install all dependencies using `poetry install`

4. Start a virtual environment `poetry shell`


### Implemented Commands

* `make flood` - run flood algorithm simulation

* `make leach` - run leach algorithm simulation

* command for run some heuristic algorithm will be added later

* `make test` - run tests
